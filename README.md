# ships-problem
An exercise on generative recursion with accumulators given to us in Fundamentals of Computer Science 1

We were told to write a program that would take in a list of ships with certain unload time and arrival times, and then find the average time a ship would be waiting to be unloaded.

An accumulator was used to represent the clock time, and generative recursion was used to process each ship in the list of ships. 

Written in ISL w/ lambda, a teaching language based off of Racket.
